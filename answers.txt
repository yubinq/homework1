What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Rebase is when you want to update the start of your branch to a later commit that happend after you branched out.
Merge is to combines the commits from the feature branch into the main branch in a new merge commit.
Merge preserves the branch topology and creates a new commit,
while Rebase provides a linear history at the expense of changing existing commit history.
